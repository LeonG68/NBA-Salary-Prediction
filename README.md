# NBA-Salary-Prediction
Met a sports agent through HN. Worked with him to create models to predict NBA salaries. This work differentiates itself from most of the existing NBA models in that most of the existing models are built on the franchise side and serve the teams (Rockets under Daryl Morey) vs the agents/players. The difference this makes is that on the players/agent's side, when a player gets a contract that overrepresents his value (Ex.Joahkim Noah's 4-year 72 million where he was paid wayyy more than he was worth), the player/agent is rewarded instead of punished.
